    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

        <li>3 boiled eggs (for protein!)</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p> 

    <ol>
        <li>Throw everything into a blender.</li>
        <li>Blend until the texture resembles something between concrete and regret.</li>
        <li>Pour into a cup (or directly into the sink if you have any sense).</li>
        <li>Take one sip and immediately reconsider your life choices.</li>
        <li>Offer it to a friend and watch them suffer.</li>
    </ol>
